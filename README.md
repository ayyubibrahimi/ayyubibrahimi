### Hi there 👋

I'm Ayyub.

🌐 **About me**:
I work as the Director of Research for LLEAD at the Innocence Project New Orleans (IPNO), a state-wide initiative tracking police misconduct in Louisiana. Prior to joining IPNO, I contributed to rule of law research in the U.S., South America, Europe, and the Middle East at the World Justice Project (WJP) as a Program Assistant for the research team. Before WJP, I was a research intern at the Amman Center for Human Rights Studies in Amman, Jordan, which received the UN Human Rights Prize in 2023. I hold a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.

👨‍💻 **Current Projects**:
- **Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database (LLEAD)**: Leading code/research development for LLEAD.co.
    - [View Repo](https://github.com/ipno-llead/processing)
- **Sawt**: Co-developing Sawt, a tool for New Orleanians to more easily find out what is being shared and discussed in City Council meetings.
