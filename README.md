Hello, World! üåç 

**About me**:\n
I work as the Director of Research for [LLEAD at the Innocence Project New Orleans (IPNO)](https://www.ipno.org/), the first state-wide initiative tracking police misconduct in Louisiana. Prior to joining IPNO, I contributed to rule of law research in the U.S., South America, Europe, and the Middle East at the [World Justice Project (WJP)](https://worldjusticeproject.org/) as a Program Assistant for the research team. Before WJP, I was a research intern at the [Amman Center for Human Rights Studies](https://achrs.org/english/) in Amman, Jordan, which received the UN Human Rights Prize in 2023. I hold a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.
