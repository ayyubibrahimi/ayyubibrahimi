### Welcome to my GitHub! üåü

üåê **About me**:
I work as the Director of Research for LLEAD at the Innocence Project New Orleans (IPNO), a state-wide initiative tracking police misconduct in Louisiana. Prior to joining IPNO, I contributed to rule of law research in the U.S., South America, Europe, and the Middle East at the World Justice Project (WJP) as a Program Assistant for the research team. Before WJP, I was a research intern at the Amman Center for Human Rights Studies in Amman, Jordan, which received the UN Human Rights Prize in 2023. I hold a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.
